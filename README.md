npm i

## Use
### First step
Very important step!
This is the sending of the multisend from your json generated  
Think about testing a small amount of address before doing large tests.

```
node multiSend.js
```

I voluntarily commented the broadcast to avoid errors during the tests  
To activate the broadcast, uncomment the end of the code
